Supported Platforms
###################

The official platforms supported are:

	* 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS bookworm

		* 64bit Raspberry Pi 5

	* 64-bit Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

		* ARM64 or AMD64 (x86_64) computer or docker container

But the EVP Agent
was designed to be portable,
so it probably works well in other platforms.

In the future,
other supported platforms
are planned to be supported.
